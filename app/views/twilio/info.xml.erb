    Co-Dependents Anonymous is a program of recovery from codependence. The only requirement for membership is a desire for healthy and loving relationships. We have all learned to survive life, but in CoDA we are learning to live life. 
    <% elsif @key == "codependency" %>
    At CoDA, we offer no definition or diagnostic criterion for codependence. What we do offer is a list of patterns and characteristics as a tool to aid in self evaluation. You can find this list on our website at www dot nyc coda dot org.
