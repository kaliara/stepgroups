    Information about coda. Co-Dependents Anonymous is a program of recovery from codependence. The only requirement for membership is a desire for healthy and loving relationships. We gather together each week to support and share in a journey of self-discovery. The meetings are free to attend and happen at many locations in the city. We use the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions as the principles of our program and guides to developing honest and fulfilling relationships.  These steps and traditions have been closely adapted from Alcoholics Anonymous. You can find out more in our website. The U R L is W W W, dot, N Y C ... C O D A, dot, O R G ..., ...
